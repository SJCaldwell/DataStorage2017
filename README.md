# rivalsfor.life 

Built to answer the question: How strong am I?

rivalsfor.life let's you input your personal stats and lifts to come up with your ideal powerlifting *rival*. Someone stronger than you who functions as a benchmark for you to strive toward. The powerlifter is chosen from a database containing data on over 7,000 real meets. It provides the user a dashboard and as their lifts improve, they eventually reach and exceed the lifts of their chosen rival. From there, they can gain a new rival even stronger than their last. It's a great way to get motivate yourself to keep training even if you're not the type to go to meets!
